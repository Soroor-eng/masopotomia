It was created just a few kilometers east of the old capital of the Sassanid Empire , Seleukia-Ctesiphon.  The Caliph's palace (Bab Al-Dhahab or Qubbat Al-ḫaḍraa) and the main mosque on the western bank of the Tigris were built within four years. The city was designed to be circular with the palace and mosque in the center. The district town was divided into four quarters, each with a city gate pointing in one direction.
