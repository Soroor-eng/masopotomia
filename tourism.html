         <h3>1_ Religious Tourism</h3>
           <class="karb-najaf">
           <p class="karbnaj">
            The cities of <strong>Karbala and Najaf</strong> are the most popular tourist destinations in Iraq due to the location of religious sites in the country:</p>
           <h4> Karbala</h4>
           <p class="karbala-p">
            <strong>The city, best known as the location of the Battle of Karbala in 680 CE, or the shrines of Imam Husayn and Abbas, is considered a holy city for Muslims, in the same way as Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem. The events of Karbala reflect the collision of the good versus the evil, the virtuous versus the wicked, and the collision of Imam Husayn (grandson of Prophet Muhammad-the head of virtue) versus Yazid (the head of impiety). Al-Husayn was a revolutionary person, a righteous man, the religious authority, the Imam of Muslims. The largest contemporary (millions of visitors) Muslim pilgrimage isn't the hajj to Mecca, it's the Shiite pilgrimage to Karbala in Iraq</strong>
            </p>

            />
            <p class="najaf">
            <strong>Al-Najaf</strong> is considered sacred by Shi'a Muslims. Al-Najaf is renowned as the site of the burial place of Muhammad's son in law and cousin, <strong>Imam Alī</strong> ibn Abī Tālib. The city is now a center of pilgrimage throughout the Shi'ite Islamic world. It is estimated that only Mecca and Medina receive more Muslim pilgrims. As the burial site of Shi'i Islam's second most important figure, the Imam Ali Mosque is considered by Shiites as the third holiest Islamic site.

         <p class="marshes"> 
            In southern of Iraq, much of the area around Uruk and Ur is marshland and it has been suggested that this region could one day become a popular spot for wildlife holidays and eco-tourism.<br>
            The marshlands between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers are frequently described as the Garden of Eden or the Cradle of Civilization.

         <p class="marshes-p"> 
            After the Iraq war of 1991, in an act of environmental vandalism Saddam Hussein drained the marshes and persecuted their inhabitants as punishment for an uprising against his rule. Yet one former occupant of the marshes believes the area has enormous tourism potential.<br>
            In winter the marshes now cover 76 per cent of their previous range and wildlife is returning, with water buffalo abundant, marbled teal numbering about 43,000, along with pygmy cormorants and the African darter. Another notable animal is a local species of otter, first identified by Gavin Maxwell, the author, when he toured the marshes with Wilfred Thesiger, the explorer, in 1956, and which features in his novel <strong>Ring of Bright Water</strong>.
